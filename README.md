### Manual Updates

Trigger a manual update via service call:

```yaml
service: trmnl_webhook.send_update
data:
  config_entry_id: "abc123def456"
```

### In automations

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Update TRMNL on temperature change"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.temperature_living_room
    action:
      - service: trmnl_webhook.send_update
        data:
          config_entry_id: "abc123def456"
```

## Data Format

The integration sends data in the following nested JSON format:

### Basic

```json
{
  "merge_variables": {
    "last_update": "2026-01-11 15:30:00",
    "sensor_living_room_temperature": {
      "name": "Living Room Temperature",

### With Historic Data Points

```json
{
  "merge_variables": {
    "sensor_temperature": {
      "name": "Temperature",
      "current": "21.5",
      "unit": "°C",
      "last_changed": "2026-01-11 15:30:00",
      "24h_avg": "20.83",
      "24h_min": "18.50",
      "24h_max": "23.20",
      "recent_data": [
        {"time": "13:30", "value": "20.10"},
        {"time": "14:00", "value": "20.50"},
        {"time": "14:30", "value": "21.00"},
        {"time": "15:00", "value": "21.30"},
        {"time": "15:30", "value": "21.50"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Entity Types

Numeric entities (sensors with numeric values):
- `current`: Current state
- `unit`: Unit of measurement
- `last_changed`: Last state change timestamp
- `24h_avg`, `24h_min`, `24h_max`: 24-hour statistics
- `recent_data`: Optional recent data points (if configured)

Non-numeric entities (lights, switches, device trackers, etc.):
- `current:` Current state ("on", "off", "home", etc.)
- `last_changed`: Last state change timestamp

## ℹ️ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Validation Failed

- ✅ Verify your TRMNL Webhook ID is correct
- ✅ Check that your TRMNL account is active
- ✅ Test the webhook manually via the TRMNL website

### No Data Received

- 📋 Check the logs: **Settings → System → Logs**
- 🔍 Verify the selected entities exist and have data
- 🧪 Test with a manual update via service call

### Error: "Payload too large"
- Reduce the number of entities
- Set `history_points` to `0` or a lower value
- TRMNL has a 2KB payload limit

### Integration Not Showing
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Restart Home Assistant completely
- Check `custom_components/trmnl_webhook/` folder exists
